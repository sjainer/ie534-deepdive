Deep Dive Project Data

### Team Members:
- Kevin Lu
- Shrusti Jain
- Smeet Patel
- Taobo Liao
### Problem Statement: 
Given data of post-pandemic crime in Los Angeles, what factors are predictive of future crime? In fact, can we predict future crime based on the data we have available: specifically, the type of crimes that would be prevalent, and potentially the neighborhoods in which this crime would be concentrated?
